  abstract = {The Poincare plot is a method to reflect heart rate variability, which has its unique advantages in the diagnosis of arrhythmias. At present, the research on automatic classification of Poincare plots is still in its early stage, which greatly affects the clinical application of Poincare plots. Therefore, a new algorithm is proposed in this paper, which makes comprehensive use of the Modified Hausdorff Distance and support vector machine method to do multiple classification of Poincare plots. Then the arrhythmia data in MIT-BIH ECG database were used to test the algorithm. The results showed that the classification accuracy was 90.2%, indicating that the algorithm was basically reliable and could play a certain auxiliary role in clinical Poincare plots based diagnosis classification.},
