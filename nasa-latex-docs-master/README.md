NASA-LaTeX-Docs
================

Please refer to the official documentation: [NASA-LaTeX-Docs Documentation](https://nasa.github.io/nasa-latex-docs/html)

Usage:
-------

With this LaTeX package, the formatting is all handled internally so that report developers only need to create their own content following a provided template (or even create their own). If not using a template (example: AIAA or IEEE submission), this package also comes with an incredibly versatile, OS independent, Python build script and Latexmk configuration file for easy document type-setting and warning/error detection. 

The build script is located in the following directory and can be used to build **any LaTeX document**:

    nasa-latex-docs/buildPDF.py
